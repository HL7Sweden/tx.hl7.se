The HL7 EU Terminology server, hosted at [http://tx.hl7europe.eu](http://tx.hl7europe.eu), is an instance of [Health Intersections's FHIR server](https://github.com/HealthIntersections/fhirserver), similar to [tx.fhir.org](http://tx.fhir.org) used in FHIR tooling.

The server is used for authoring and validating FHIR specifications. Please note:
> **The FHIR Tooling eco-system exists to support design time and publication usage. It is not intended to support production use, and should not be used in operational systems.**

This documentation describes the server setup.
